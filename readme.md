Tiny Timer ng
=============
A small Angular.js timer app running in a browser. Counts elapsed time and can be set to alert after a certain time.

Note: this is a work-in-progress Angular.js port of [Tiny Timer](https://github.com/DocV/TinyTimer) and does not yet have all the functionality of the original.
